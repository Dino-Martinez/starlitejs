# starlite.js

## A comprehensive and extensible game engine using JavaScript and HTML Canvas

Our goal with Starlite is to provide a fun and easy alternative to the old Flash games concept. Learning something as large as Unity can be complex and time consuming, but coding your own game from scratch requires learning or making a new engine. We're here to solve that. Our engine will be robust and comprehensive, as well as easily digestible. Our end goal is to provide a web-app that simulates a bit of what unity does (drag and drop scene creation and in-app entity editing), while remaining web-based. For now, we are only offering 2D resources, but in the future we may branch into 3D. We also may build an auto-deploy feature that puts your created game on a website that we host.
