# starlite.js

## A comprehensive and extensible game engine using JavaScript and HTML Canvas. Built with ES6 Classes and Object Oriented Design, our goal is to make browser games easy and fun to build.

# Installation

`npm i starlite`

# UPDATE NOTES:

We have decided to upgrade our tools by integrating [Matter]() as our underlying physics engine.
We will be pivoting from building our own physics to, instead, building a game engine on top of Matter.
This process is currently under way.
